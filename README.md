# Airline Manager

*CLI tool used to manage an airline. Group project @ FEUP.*

This project was made in December of 2021 as part of the Algorithms and Data Structures course at FEUP. It was made using C++ and OOP as well as algorithms (binary search, sorting, etc) and data structures (stack, queue, bst, etc) approached in class.

### Context

A new airline has joined the market and needs a management system to coordinate their operations.
The goal of the project was to create a managment system that could allow the airline to manage their operations. Thus, we needed to worry about planes, flights and baggage logistics as well as passengers and tickets organization.

### Program

Our solution to this problem was a **CLI** (Command Line Interface) that allows you to manage all the airline information. Each component (Airports, Flight, Plane, …) were implemented separately in different classes and were brought together in the Airline Class, which is the main controller of the program. Then, to make it into a user-friendly interface we created the App, which is independent to the Airline.
